This is a work in progress version of the code from
> John Dougrez-Lewis, Maria Liakata, Elena Kochkina, Yulan He. Learning Disentangled Latent Topics for Twitter Rumour Veracity Classification. Findings of ACL-IJCNLP 2021.

The code is not yet ready for use, it will be finalized and include running instructions at the time the conference paper is live. Much of the code for disentanglement comes from the work by
> Jichuan Zeng, Jing Li, Yulan He, Cuiyun Gao, Michael Lyu, Irwin King. What You Say and How You Say it: Joint Modeling of Topics and Discourse in Microblog Conversations. TACL 2019.

TODO: What about Twitter's data policy?
You'll need to download the PHEME dataset for starters.

Step 1: Converting PHEME dataset to DISENTANGLE input.

Step 2: Running DISENTANGLE.

Step 3: Moving DISENTANGLE output to LINEAR and running LINEAR for final results.
